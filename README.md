# Tetris
Developed with ES6 and PIXI.js

# Notes
1. Hosting the main directory will run appliaction written in ES6 with modules syntax. These are not supported by Firefox, unless you turn on dom.moduleScripts.enabled flag in Firefoxe's about:config (Chrome is working fine).
2. Slightly babelized version (import/exports removed) is located in ./src/.

# Setting up the project

2. execute command "npm install http-server -g" (https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)
3. execute command "http-server" in the ./src/ directory.
4. The game is now awailable at localhost:8080.
